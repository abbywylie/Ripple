# ⚡ The First 48 Hours Rule

## Why the First 48 Hours Matter

According to networking consultants, the first **48 hours** after a meeting are the most critical for:
1. **Solidifying your impression** with the contact
2. **Setting the foundation** for long-term follow-up
3. **Demonstrating professionalism** and attention to detail

## 📋 Initial Follow-Up Sequence

### **Within 24 Hours: The "Thank You" Message**

| **Tier** | **Required Content** |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Tier 1 (Dream)** | Highly personalized. Mention 2–3 specific takeaways, anchor future action. |
| **Tier 2 (Great)** | Personalized. Mention 1 specific topic, offer value or introduction. |
| **Tier 3 (Curious)** | Brief and courteous. Mention the context of the meeting. |

### **Within 48 Hours: The "Connection Request"**

- Always include a personalized LinkedIn note
- For Mentors: Proactively schedule next check-in
- For Friends: Use appropriate platform (LinkedIn or personal)

## 🚨 Best Practices

1. **Avoid the pitch** - Initial follow-up is for gratitude, not requests
2. **Proofread relentlessly** - Typos kill professionalism
3. **Vary the medium** - Email primary, but handwritten cards for Tier 1 can differentiate
