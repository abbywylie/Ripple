# Setting and Tracking Goals

The Goals page helps you set networking objectives and track your progress.

## Creating a Goal

2. Enter a goal title (e.g., "Connect with 10 recruiters this month")
3. Set a target date
4. Add a description (optional)
5. Break it down into steps (optional)

## Goal Steps

Break large goals into smaller, actionable steps:

- Example: "Goal: Get 5 informational interviews" → Steps: "Research companies", "Reach out to contacts", "Schedule meetings", etc.
