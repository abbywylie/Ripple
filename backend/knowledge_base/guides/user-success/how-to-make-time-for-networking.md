College can be a stressful time for many students and time management can be one of the most crucial — but tricky — skills to master.

Attending classes, studying for exams, making friends, and taking time to relax and decompress can quickly fill up your schedule. If you often find yourself wishing there were more hours in the day, this guide will offer time management tips for students so you can accomplish what you need to get done, have fun with your friends, and gain back some valuable time for yourself. 

1. Create a Calendar
Don’t be caught by surprise by an important paper due two days from now or a dinner with your family the same night you planned for a group study session. Create a calendar for yourself with all your upcoming deadlines, exams, social events, and other time commitments well in advance so you can see what’s coming up. 

Keep your calendar in a place where you can see it every day, such as in your planner or on your wall above your desk. If you prefer a digital calendar, check it first thing every day to keep those important events fresh and top-of-mind. For greater efficiency, make sure you can integrate it with your other tools, such as your email.

Digital calendar options include: 

Google Calendar 
Outlook Calendar
Fantastical
Calendly
2. Set Reminders
After you’ve created your calendar, give yourself periodic reminders to stay on track such as to complete a study guide in advance or schedule a meeting for a group project. Knowing deadlines is important; however, staying on top of the micro tasks involved in meeting those deadlines is just as important. You can set an alarm on your phone, write it down in a physical planner, or add an alert to your digital calendar. The reminders will help to prevent things from slipping through the cracks during particularly hectic days.

Make sure you’ve allotted enough time to study for that big test or write that final paper. Time management is all about setting yourself up for success in advance and giving yourself the tools to accomplish tasks with confidence. 


3. Build a Personalized Schedule
Each person’s day-to-day is different and unique to them, so make sure your schedule works for you. Once you’ve accounted for consistent commitments such as classes or your shifts at work, add in study sessions, extracurriculars, chores and errands, and social engagements.

Consider your personal rhythm. If you typically start your day energized, plan to study or accomplish chores then. If you fall into an afternoon slump, give yourself that time to take a guilt-free TV break or see friends.

Having a schedule that works for you will help maximize your time. Plus, knowing exactly when your laundry day is or when your intramural volleyball practice is every week will help you avoid trying to cram everything in one day (or running out of clean socks!)

4. Use Tools That Work For You
Just like your calendar and schedule, the tools you use to keep you organized should be the right fit for you. Some students prefer physical planners and paper, while some prefer going totally digital. Your calendar can help you with long-term planning, but most of these tools are best for prioritizing from day to day.

Explore what best suits your needs with some of the following suggestions:

Planners
Planners can help you keep track of long-term deadlines, such as important essay deadlines, upcoming exams, and appointments and meetings. They often provide a monthly overview each month, as well as day-to-day planning sections, so you can stay ahead.

Scheduling
If your schedule is jam-packed and you have trouble figuring out what to do and when, scheduling day by day — and sometimes even hour by hour — can help you slot in everything you need to do with less stress.

Asana
Trello
Structured app
Note Taking
From class to study sessions to errands, keeping track of everything can feel overwhelming. Keeping everything in one place, whether on the go or at your desk, can help keep you organized.

Bullet journals
Notion
Evernote
5. Prioritize
Sometimes there really is too much to do with too little time. In these instances, take just a few minutes to evaluate your priorities. Consider which deadlines are most urgent, as well as how much energy you have. 

If you are able to complete simple tasks first, try getting them out of the way before moving on to tasks that require a lot of focus. This can help to alleviate some of the pressure by checking a couple things off your to-do list without getting bogged down too early.

If you are struggling to fit everything in your schedule, consider what you can postpone or what you can simply say no to. Your friends will likely understand if you have to meet them for coffee another time in order to get in a final library session before a challenging exam. 

6. Make Time to Have Fun — And For Yourself
Time management isn’t just about getting work done. It’s also about ensuring that you can put yourself and your mental wellbeing first. Consistently including time for yourself in your schedule helps to keep your mental health and your life in balance. It can also be helpful to have things to look forward to when going through stressful periods.  

Whether it’s going for a bike ride along the river, spending time with your friends and family, or simply sleeping in on a Sunday, knowing you have space to relax and do things you enjoy can provide better peace of mind. 

7. Find Support 
Preparation and organization can sometimes only get you so far. Luckily, you have plenty of people rooting for your success. Keep yourself and your classmates on task by finding an accountability partner or study buddies. Remind your roommates when you need extra space to work on a paper. 

Your school’s academic resource center is also there to support you and point you in the right direction if you need additional help. Getting — and staying — organized is a collaborative effort and no one can do it on their own. 

8. Be Realistic and Flexible 
Sometimes unforeseen circumstances will come up or you simply may not be able to get to everything you set out to do in a given day. Be patient with yourself when things don’t go exactly to plan. When building your calendar, schedule, and priorities list, be realistic about what you can accomplish and include buffer time if you’re unsure. This can help to reduce obstacles and potential friction.

Time management isn’t just about sticking to a rigid schedule — it’s also about giving yourself space for change.

\# Medium blog  https://medium.com/the-ascent/networking-tips-for-college-students-with-no-job-connections-or-network-504d7e5a52cf
Networking as a college student is hard, and it’s even harder if you lack the gateway resources that make networking more accessible. For example, holding a part-time job at a firm would introduce you to coworkers who can bring you along to events. Since most students don’t have career-path jobs and high-powered connections, this article will explain how to start a network from scratch.

My tips are broken down into two parts. Firstly, I’ll explain where to network and then I’ll dive into how you can do it.

Join Professional Associations
Every industry has at least one professional association, like the Canadian PR Society or Canadian Bankers’ Association. These organizations often charge lower membership fees for students, which are worth it when you factor in the free food and members-only events. Certain associations offer mentoring and leadership development programs.

If you’re not sure which associations exist in your field, then try a Google search and ask your professors.

Attend Campus Events
Your university will have alumni events, career fairs, and speaker series. These events are networking gold because they are tailored to students! You don’t need an internship with Google on your resume to access these services; you just need to put on a clean shirt.

Do your own research
There are lots of one-off events happening in major cities. To find them, you should regularly search Eventbrite’s networking section. However, I’ve also found interesting events via Facebook’s “happening near you” section and through straight up Google searches. There is a conference for pretty much everything.

Now you know where to network. It’s time to dive into the “how” part of the equation.

Here are my 5 tips to make networking easier:

Try attending events with a speaker and a clearly established theme. Do a bit of research on the speaker and the theme in advance, so then you’ll be able to discuss the main topic with anyone in the room.
Three years ago, I gave myself the goal of asking a question at every event that I attend. It pushed me to ask a question about diplomacy to former Prime Minister Paul Martin at an event. Asking a question means that the whole room hears your name and one poignant thought that you had that day. This can help break the ice in later conversations.
Start following my networking advice enough to find a mentor, and then reevaluate. Talk to them about your goals and what you want to get out of networking. A good mentor will help you piece it all together.
If I’m watching a speech at an event, and it’s not extremely formal, then I’ll usually live tweet it. Interacting with the attendees on Twitter can expose you to people who you otherwise may have not spoken to. Make sure to tag presenters’ Twitter handles when you reference their quotes.
After an event, consider writing a thank you post on LinkedIn to the organizers or writing about what you learned at the event. LinkedIn is perfect for this; the algorithm is popping and the content reachers far more people than on Facebook.

 Let’s be real—running a business, leading a team, or growing a career is already a full-time job.

Add in family, personal responsibilities, and the should-do list of marketing, sales, and self-care, and it’s easy to let networking fall to the bottom of the priority list.

But here’s the truth: Your network is your most valuable business asset.

70% of business deals and new clients come from networking, not cold outreach (Forbes).  Women with strong networks are promoted 34% more often and grow their businesses 35% faster (McKinsey & Co.).

If you’re thinking, “That sounds great, but I don’t have time for networking,”—we hear you.

The good news? You don’t need more time. You need a better system.

Let’s break down how to integrate networking into your weekly schedule without overwhelm, while executing consistent follow-up to stay top-of-mind.

Step 1: Shift Your Mindset – Networking is Not Extra Work
Many women see networking as a task—something to squeeze into an already packed schedule.

But networking is a business growth strategy, not a nice-to-have.

The most successful women in business don’t “find time” for networking—they build relationships in the time they already have.

Think of networking like planting seeds. The more you nurture your connections, the more opportunities, referrals, and collaborations will grow—without chasing them.

Reframe networking as a priority, not an obligation.
Understand that small, consistent actions matter more than occasional big efforts.

Now, let’s get tactical.

Step 2: Incorporate Networking Into Your Weekly Schedule
Here’s how to integrate networking into your routine without feeling like you’re adding more to your to-do list.

1. Block Non-Negotiable Networking Time 
Just like you schedule meetings, client work, and family time—schedule networking.

15-Minute Daily Power Networking: Spend 15 minutes engaging on LinkedIn, sending quick messages, or commenting on posts.
Weekly Virtual or In-Person Coffee Chats: Book 1-2 networking conversations a week.
Monthly Networking Event or Mastermind: Attend a Women’s Business League event or an industry meet-up.

Example: One WBL member dedicates 30 minutes every Friday morning for outreach—following up with new contacts and checking in on existing ones. It’s a small time investment with a huge return.

2. Use “Double Duty” Networking 💡
You don’t always need separate time for networking—you can layer it into activities you’re already doing.

Turn Commutes Into Connection Time: Send voice messages or quick check-ins while driving or walking.
Upgrade Lunch Breaks: Instead of eating solo, invite a business connection for a virtual or in-person lunch.
Leverage Events You’re Already Attending: Going to a conference? Be intentional about making 3-5 key connections.

Example: A busy entrepreneur in WBL schedules one networking coffee per week right after school drop-off—turning a routine activity into a relationship-building opportunity.

3. Automate & Systematize Networking 
Consistency is key—but it doesn’t have to be manual. Automate where you can.

Use a CRM or Spreadsheet to track your top contacts and when you last connected.
Set Calendar Reminders for follow-ups so key relationships don’t slip through the cracks.
Leverage LinkedIn Alerts to congratulate people on milestones and stay engaged.

Example: A WBL member set up an auto-reminder every Monday to check in with 3 people in her network. Five minutes of effort keeps her top-of-mind with key connections.

Step 3: Execute Consistent Follow-Up to Stay Top-of-Mind
A one-time conversation won’t build a relationship. The fortune is in the follow-up.

Here’s how to keep the connection alive without feeling pushy or transactional:

1. The 3-Touch Follow-Up System
After meeting someone new, follow this framework:

Day 1: Immediate Follow-Up – Send a quick thank-you message or LinkedIn connection request.
Week 2: Add Value – Share an article, introduce them to someone, or check in on a topic you discussed.
Month 1: Personalized Check-In – Ask how they’re doing, offer support, or suggest another touchpoint.

Example: A WBL member met a potential partner at an event. She followed up with a quick thank-you message, sent an industry article two weeks later, and a month later, invited her to a WBL networking session. That relationship turned into a referral partnership.

2. Use the 80/20 Rule for Relationship Nurturing
Not all contacts require the same level of engagement. Focus 80% of your efforts on the top 20% of your network—those who are most aligned with your goals.

Tier 1: High-Value Connections (mentors, referral partners, top clients) → Monthly check-ins.
Tier 2: Industry Peers & Collaborators → Quarterly touchpoints.
Tier 3: Casual Contacts → Engage via social media when relevant.

Example: A business owner in WBL prioritizes key relationships first—checking in monthly with top referral partners, while keeping a lighter touch with others.

3. Keep It Simple & Authentic
Follow-up doesn’t have to be formal—just stay in touch in a natural way.

✔️ Celebrate Wins – Congratulate people on achievements or milestones.
✔️ Share Opportunities – Pass along job leads, event invites, or helpful resources.
✔️ Be a Connector – Introduce people who could help each other.

Networking isn’t about asking—it’s about giving. The more value you provide, the more opportunities come back to you.

Final Thought: Small Actions, Big Impact
You don’t need more time to network—you need a better approach.

Prioritize relationships like you prioritize revenue.
Make networking a natural part of your routine.
Follow up consistently, and watch your opportunities grow.
Your next client, collaboration, or career breakthrough is already in your network—you just need to nurture it.

\# ChatGPT primer in case this isn't enough:

Help Students Build Consistency With Busy Schedules

A Beginner-Friendly Primer

1. Why Consistency Matters

Consistency isn’t about being perfect every day—it’s about showing up often enough that progress becomes automatic. When you build small, steady habits, you:

Reduce procrastination and last-minute stress

Make big tasks feel manageable

Balance school, activities, work, and rest

Feel more in control of your time and choices

2. Understanding Your Real Life (Not Your Ideal One)

Before you create routines, you need to understand what your days actually look like.

Try this:

For 2–3 days, jot down:

What you did

When you started and finished

How long things really took

This gives you a clearer picture of your energy levels, free pockets of time, and hidden time drains.

3. Start Small: What Consistency Really Means

Consistency = small actions repeated often, not strict schedules or long study marathons.

Examples:

Reading 10 minutes a day

Reviewing notes for 5 minutes after class

Doing one practice problem before dinner

These tiny steps build momentum and cut down the stress of catching up.

4. The Most Common Challenges (You’re Not Alone!)

Students often struggle with:

Overscheduling or saying “yes” to too many things

Underestimating how long tasks take

Forgetting assignments

Phone and social distractions

Being tired or running on too little sleep

Feeling overwhelmed and not knowing where to start

This primer will give you tools to handle all of these.

5. Essential Tools to Build Consistency
A. A 10–15 Minute Weekly Reset

Pick one time each week to check in with yourself:

Look at upcoming deadlines

Add commitments (work shifts, practices, events)

Choose your “top 3” priorities for the week

Adjust anything that looks too packed

This is your anchor.

B. Simple Visual Scheduling

Use whatever you like—paper planner, phone calendar, wall chart.

Include:

Class times

Work or practices

Travel and meals

Study blocks (short ones!)

Free/rest time

Seeing your week makes it easier to make smart choices.

C. The Two-Minute Rule

If a task takes two minutes or less, do it now:

Email a professor

Organize notes

Put an assignment on your calendar

This fights procrastination and keeps small tasks from piling up.

D. “Non-Negotiables” List

Choose 3–5 things you always protect in your schedule, like:

Sleep

Classes

Meals

One short daily study session

These keep your routine stable even on chaotic days.

E. Build Habits With “Habit Stacking”

Attach a small new habit to something you already do:

After brushing your teeth → read 5 minutes

After class → review notes for 3 minutes

After dinner → prep tomorrow’s materials

This requires almost no willpower.

6. A Simple Step-by-Step Framework
Step 1: Identify your fixed commitments

Classes, work, sports, recurring meetings.

Step 2: Add flexible tasks around them

Homework, study blocks, chores, appointments.

Step 3: Pick 1–2 habits to focus on

Keep them tiny and realistic.

Step 4: Track progress simply

Checkmarks, dots, a quick note. No need for elaborate apps.

Step 5: Review and adjust weekly

What worked? What didn’t? What needs shifting?

Consistency grows from small improvements.

7. Examples & Templates (Use or Adapt)
Sample Daily Routine

7:00 — Wake up, stretch

8:00–12:00 — Classes

12:00 — Lunch + two-minute tasks

1:00–3:00 — Homework/Study

3:00–5:00 — Work/Sports

6:00 — Dinner

7:00 — Short review session

9:30 — Wind down

10:00 — Bed

8. Encouragement & Mindset Tips

You don’t have to be perfect—just present.

A missed day is normal, not a failure.

Progress comes from small wins, not heroic effort.

Celebrate consistency, even if the habit is tiny.

Adjust routines to fit your life—not someone else’s.

9. Final Reminder

Consistency isn’t created by strict discipline or by having a calm schedule.
It’s built through simple habits, clear priorities, and tiny repeated actions that fit your real, busy life.

You’re capable of building routines that support your goals—one small step at a time.
