Networking is the process of making connections and building relationships. These connections can provide you with advice and contacts, which can help you make informed career decisions. Networking can even help you ﬁnd unadvertised jobs/internships. Networking can take place in a group or one-on-one setting.

Networking is not simply an information exchange between you and another person. It involves establishing relationships with people who will often become your friends and community of colleagues as you go through your career. They may be able to help you advance your career in many ways, just as you may be able to help them advance theirs. A networking contact might result in any of the following:
\# bullet points 
Inside information on what’s happening in your field of interest, such as an organization’s plan to expand operations or release a new product.
Job search advice specific to your field of interest, like where jobs are typically listed.
Tips on your job hunting tools (i.e. resume and/or portfolio).
Names of people to contact about possible employment or informational interviews.
Follow-up interview and possible job offer.

Developing your network is easy because you know more people than you think you know. Consider:
\# bullet points
family, friends, roommates, and significant others 
School faculty and staff, fellow students, and alumni
past and present co-workers
neighbors
club, organization, and association members
people at the gym, the local coffee house, and neighborhood store
people in your religious community

These people are all part of your current network, professional and personal. Keep an ongoing list of the names and contact information of the people in your network. Ask your contacts to introduce you to their contacts and keep your list growing (don’t forget to offer to reciprocate!). Opportunities to network with people arise at any time and any place. Never underestimate an opportunity to make a connection.

1. WHAT IS NETWORKING? 
Networking is the process of discovering and utilizing existing connections between people. This term 
also implies moving beyond your immediate network and tapping into other people’s networks, perhaps 
far-removed from your own. Everyone knows other people and thus already has a network. Genuine 
networks often stem from friendships or business relationships. 
Networking is a planned process. In formal and informal settings, you will interact with and become 
known to people who can provide information about the world of work, job openings, leads, personal 
contacts, and employers who are hiring. Networking is about talking with people and obtaining referrals 
so that every contact you make is based on a referral from a person you know on some level. You may 
feel a bit awkward asking for help this way in the beginning. It takes skill to network effectively. 
Networking is a must to uncover job opportunities in the "hidden" job market, which may constitute over 
80% of jobs. The fact is direct one-to-one contact with people, preferably face to face, is by far the most 
effective way to get a job or internship. 
2. HOW DO I NETWORK? 
Talk about yourself and your goals and express true curiosity about others. When you share about your 
skills and interests, what you have done, what you would like to do and where you’d like to do it, the 
more likely people will begin to see links between themselves and you.  
Ask questions! Most people are flattered if you ask questions about what they do and how they got there, 
and if you ask for their opinions and advice. People will begin to share information about their own 
backgrounds and who they know and where they have been. 
Remember that everyone knows of other people in their own field, but also in other fields and often in 
other geographic locations, so often people you already know can connect you to other valuable contacts. 
Plan for networking! Anticipate when you will be in a position to network and plan what you want to ask, 
what you want to communicate about yourself and how. For example, you might plan to take resumes to a 
job fair, but it would be awkward to take resumes to a social or sporting event. If you want to build your 
network in a particular field or area, one of the most effective strategies for doing so is informational 
interviewing. 
3. ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKING  
Online social networking sites are websites that allow people to join online communities with other 
people by schools, places of employment, interests, geographical information, etc. These online 
communities allow people to interact through blogs, pictures, videos, instant messaging, or text. Because 
of the ability to link together with people from around the world, many college students find these sites 
rather appealing. You might be a member of one or more social networking sites currently. Facebook and 
Twitter are a few examples of the most popular networking sites available on the internet. Although many 
of these sites are used by millions of people, there are some pros and cons you should be aware of before 
joining these online communities. 
Pros: 
Social networking sites allow people to communicate more efficiently than ever before. Many of these 
sites allow its members to connect with people who share similar interests. Instead of only learning 
potential persons of interest in your local city or state, with the internet you can now make connections to 
other countries. Networking outside of your geographical area can increase your chances of possible 
employment. Because 80% of jobs are obtained through networking meeting new people associated with 
similar career interests, majors, or student organizations can really give you an advantage! 
Within many of these social networking sites are groups or other communities you can join in order to 
specify areas of interest as well as narrow your contacts for specific interests. For every field of work 
there are current issues affecting that field. Because of this, it is important to stay knowledgeable within 
your field. These sites can allow you to ask questions and to join discussions on hot topics. You can also 
utilize your new friends to find out when opportunities become available in the organization or company 
you are interested in working for. 
Cons: 
You might be asking yourself, "So, what’s the big deal? All of my friends have Facebook." Remember, 
anyone can potentially see your information that you post. This means status updates on Twitter and 
tagged pictures and group affiliations on Facebook could cost you that dream job or internship. Never 
post anything that might damage your credibility. Every employer who might consider hiring you will 
more than likely search online for your name. Knowing that Google.com is a great place to start, try 
googling your name and see what you find. You might be shocked to see what is out there on the web 
about you! As a rule, if you have to question whether or not to post something, don’t. 
4. PROFESSIONAL NETWORKING  
Professional networking sites are websites that allow people to join online communities in the same 
manner as social networking sites. The difference between the two is that professional sites are used 
primarily to understand more about your current or desired field and to stay connected with other 
professionals in a more specialized community. Because of the nature of professional networking, all 
students should begin thinking about establishing a professional network before graduating from college.  
Do not wait until your last year of undergraduate study to begin seeking out professional 
connections. 
While you might have multiple social networking accounts the most important thing to keep in mind is 
converting your social networking style to a more professional one. Many professionals either delete or 
seriously alter their existing accounts on social networking sites before entering the workforce. Keep your 
professional career in mind when creating social networking profiles. You can be in an internship during 
your second year in college and still make professional connections. 
Identify your short-term and long-term professional goals and what you need to reach them. 
Understand that professional networking in general is not "using" someone. This is also the case with 
online professional networking. A healthy online network is one where you can contribute to the 
professional development of others as well as your own. You want to begin by fully engaging your 
profile. A profile where you specify past and present employment and career interests gives others an idea 
of your career goals. Prior to setting up an account, have in mind where you would like to be in 2-3 years 
as well as where you want to be in 5-10 years. Knowing your short-term and long-term professional goals 
helps you to accurately seek out professionals who can help you best.  
Research key information about employers or industries. 
Before seeking out or engaging your contacts within a professional online community you want to be 
knowledgeable about your field as well as specific employers of interest. Professionals will recognize you 
as someone who is serious about his or her career knowing current issues, professional organizations, and 
hiring trends. You can find much of this information online on employer websites, journals and 
publications in your industry, and general inquiries on sites like Google or Yahoo. 
Talk with professionals in your network to find employers and industries of interest 
Once you have connected with professionals through online professional networking sites in your area of 
interest, begin talking with them about their interests. Look for any similarities. These discussions can 
open up opportunities where you can find out more information about industries or employers that you 
cannot though online searches. These contacts will be able to articulate for your specific questions like 
describing a typical day working for a specific employer or identifying areas of experience needed before 
gaining a particular position. Although you do not want to use your network only to find employment, 
these connections could allow you to seek out possible employment opportunities. Use your 
understanding of the employer or industry to articulate how your skills are beneficial to what they are 
looking for. 
Give back to your network.  
After you have gathered information and networked with others keep in mind that giving back to your 
network helps you to maintain your network. It is considered a poor practice to only gather information, 
but not serve as a contact to give information. Send your contacts thank you cards after talking with them 
through the site. Also, now that you know areas of interest from your network, seek out journal articles, 
websites, programs, or other information that will help them in their development and notify them of your 
findings. 
LinkedIn 
The most popular professional networking site is LinkedIn - a professional networking site focusing on 
meeting people within different areas of the workforce. This site has become increasing popular among 
recent college graduates and professionals in various fields. Once you make connections with others 
whom you know, it becomes even easier to talk with the professionals of the connections you recently 
made. Meeting more and more of the professionals in your desired area expands your network! Career 
and Internship Services recommends you utilize LinkedIn to help you professionally as you focus on your 
career development. Maintaining your online network is only one method of professional communication. 
Getting involved with professional organizations gives you an opportunity to network in other ways.
