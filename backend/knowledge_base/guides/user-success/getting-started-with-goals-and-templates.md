\# Getting Started with Goals & Templates in Ripple

Ripple is designed to help students stay consistent with their networking by setting measurable goals, using customizable templates, and tracking progress over time.

\---

\#\# 1\. Setting Your First Networking Goal

To create a goal, go to the \*\*Goals tab\*\* in the sidebar.

You can define:  
\- A clear title (e.g., "Connect with 3 alumni this month")  
\- A brief description of your intent  
\- A deadline or target date  
\- A numeric target (optional)  
\- A list of sub-steps or milestones (e.g., "Find alumni", "Send intro message", "Schedule call")

Each goal can be tracked:  
\- By completing steps and updating current progress  
\- Through color-coded statuses (In Progress, Completed)  
\- With a visual progress bar that updates automatically  
\- In the Dashboard and Progress pages as part of your overall relationship-building activity

\#\# 2\. Using Ripple Templates to Write Better Emails

Ripple offers AI-suggested and editable templates to help you get started with messaging:

Templates are available for:  
\- Initial outreach (e.g., to alumni, recruiters, or peers)  
\- Informational interview requests  
\- Follow-ups  
\- Thank-you messages after meetings or interviews

You can:  
\- Customize templates by \*\*relationship type\*\* (e.g., alum, friend, professional)  
\- Save versions of messages that worked well  
\- Ask the chatbot for a specific template by saying things like:  
  \- “Can you help me write a follow-up to an alum I just met?”  
  \- “Give me an intro message for someone in consulting”

\---

\#\# 3\. Personalization \+ Gmail Plugin

Ripple's \*\*Gmail plugin\*\* (for Gmail users only) enhances this experience by:  
\- Scanning your inbox for outreach and replies  
\- Suggesting templates based on your communication history  
\- Automatically updating goal progress or contact activity

If installed, it keeps everything in sync — no need to copy-paste.

\#\# 4\. Ask the Chatbot

If you're unsure how to:  
\- Phrase a message  
\- Set an appropriate goal  
\- Know when to follow up

Just ask the Ripple chatbot:    
“Help me write a thank-you message after an informational interview” or    
“How do I stay consistent with outreach goals this semester?”

\#\# TL;DR for RAG Chatbot

When a user needs help with consistency, messaging, or setting goals:  
\- Guide them to the \*\*Goals tab\*\*  
\- Recommend using \*\*Templates\*\* to save time  
\- Mention the Gmail plugin if they’re a Gmail user  
\- Remind them they can track their steps and deadlines within each goal
