Preparing for life after college becomes a high priority during senior year, but forward-looking students (and parents!) know it can start almost as soon as freshmen settle in on campus.

Here are guidelines to help you — and your student — understand what can and should be done each year.

1st year — Explore career options
With so many new experiences, it’s easy to overlook career-related activities. But with no deadlines looming, the first year of college is the perfect time to seek out information on a variety of fields. Three strategies to suggest:

Join new organizations to get a feel for different areas of interest and possible related careers.
Attend job fairs. Although your student may not be eligible for an internship or co-op position quite yet, this is a great chance to see how job fairs work without the pressure to impress everyone they meet. Your student can make note of:
Which companies are participating
What positions they’re hiring for
What qualifications they’re looking for (major, GPA, year in school, past experience, etc.)
Conduct informational interviews and job shadow. Often overlooked by students, these are terrific ways to get a real sense for what a particular job is like day-to-day as well as to start building a professional network.
Internship: A one-term employment period, usually full-time during the summer but occasionally part-time during the semester. Internships can be paid or unpaid, and are usually related to a student's field of study.

Co-op Position: A more structured work arrangement where students alternate full-time employment one semester with full-time study the next, requiring at least two or more terms of work. Co-ops are paid positions directly related to a student's field of study.

2nd & 3rd years — Find an internship or co-op position
With most employers expecting real-world work experience in their new hires, it’s important for students to gain as much hands-on experience as they can before graduation. Many students aren’t aware that the college recruiting schedule is six months to one year ahead of the start date. This means students can start looking for an internship or co-op position in the fall. Some recruiters interview for these positions as early as October, with pre-interview activities taking place in September. Other summer internship opportunities will have deadlines in January and February.

Ways to support your sophomore/junior:

Make sure they have a strong, updated resumé that highlights their past accomplishments instead of just listing their job responsibilities.
Remind them to make enrolling in the college career center’s online system a priority. Many schools require this in order to RSVP for events, sign up for interviews and apply for jobs.
Encourage them to attend as many recruiting events as they can:
Job fairs
Information sessions
Employer panels
Employer-led workshops
Other networking events
Each recruiting event can be approached as a networking opportunity. Encourage your student to talk to the employer representatives, get a business card and follow up with a thank-you email.

Though most students have large social networks, they often struggle with the concept of a professional network. Talk about the importance of building a professional network and share ideas on how to do this. Great people to have in their network include professors, career services staff, alumni, guest speakers, etc. Your advice and wisdom in this area could go a long way in laying the groundwork for their future career.
Senior year – Career launch!
Graduation and a degree may be right around the corner, but there’s a lot to do during this final year of college. As with internships and co-ops, recruiters start making offers in the fall for permanent full-time positions that begin in May or June. Seniors who put off their job search until the last couple months of spring semester, or the summer after graduation, will have missed out on many opportunities.

Things to know and ways to help:

Most students are so focused on making it through their last year that the idea of also starting a full-time job search can be overwhelming. Encourage your student to find a balance, but don’t let them procrastinate. If they accept an offer in the fall, second semester will be much less stressful!
Now is the time to clean up social media accounts. Yes, many employers will Google students before deciding to offer them a job. If your student hasn’t updated their various social media accounts to present a professional image, they should tackle this task before getting too far along in the job search.
Most student resumés look the same. Make sure your student is prepared by having a resumé that makes them stand out from the crowd. And, just like the resumé, their interviewing skills need to be top-notch. If they can’t explain how their skills and experiences match an employer’s needs, they’ll lose out to someone who can. You can help by encouraging them to visit the career services office to fine-tune their resumé and interviewing skills. If they need more one-on-one help, find a professional experienced in these areas to coach them.

Freshman Year

The moment you step foot on your college campus is the moment you begin building your network. The people you meet at freshman orientation, in freshman lectures, at a party, in the student center, or essentially anywhere could play the most instrumental roles in your post-graduate career. There are a few easy steps to take to cultivate the connections you make your freshman year of college that can last a lifetime. These connections can turn into connections to your future, including co-workers, bosses and, of course, friends!

1.     Be Gregarious. Be Social. Talk to anyone and everyone, there is no need to be picky or exclusive. "Everyone has a network. Your friends, family friends, classmates, employers, graduate teaching assistants, hairdresser, dean, librarian, professors, and, yes, neighbors, are all in your network and can help you expand your contacts. No one starts from scratch and you never know where any connection may lead." -- Lindsey Pollak, author of Getting from College to Career. Don’t be too selective in networking; keep your net wide. The average college student changes their major approximately two times; therefore, a lot can change over the course of four years. Dreams and goals could align by senior year.

2.     Be Interested. Building meaningful relationships means taking time to truly get to know people. Ask questions, not just about their goals and career plans, but also about their family and hobbies. Then open up. Cultivating a meaningful network is about building genuine relationships and friendships.

3.     Be Adventurous. Step out of your comfort zone. Don’t be afraid to strike up a conversation with a random stranger. Join a variety of social clubs and organizations, including Greek life. Sororities and fraternities are tight-knit groups; they will often lend a hand to their members.

4.     Be Intentional. Set networking goals for yourself each semester. Whether it is joining a new club or meeting a certain number of people, always challenge yourself. 

Sophomore Year

The exhilaration, challenges, and not to mention the awkwardness of your freshman year are far behind you. By now, you’ve hopefully settled on a major and are beginning to iron out a few post-graduate plans. Therefore, your sophomore year is a great time to begin to focus on specific network goals.

1.     Be Polite. Set a goal to meet one new person everyday. Whether it is just saying hello or taking time to strike up a conversation, you will organically build your network, as well as, work on your people skills.

2.     Be Active. Get involved with clubs and organizations that are specifically aligned with your major. By obtaining memberships to professional organizations, you can ultimately give yourself a boost in attaining future goals.

3.     Be Proactive. "There is absolutely, positively no better strategy to figure out what career or careers you might want to pursue, and then break into that field, than talking to people who have done it themselves." -- Lindsey Pollak, author of Getting from College to Career. Meet with professors, mentors, potential employers, and other professionals. They have a wealth of knowledge about their specific fields and have ample contacts that could be assets to your network. They can also help you find an internship, which could potentially parlay into a post-graduate job. 

Junior Year

Your junior year is key to networking. In between lectures, studying, parties, trips to the library or wherever you may go, make the most of your junior year. Continue cultivating a meaningful network by adding more professors, mentors, and advisors to your network, as well as, continue to search for potential internships.

1.     Be Retrospective. Take a look back at your networking goals that you have set over the past two years. Did you meet them? If not, take the time to evaluate why. Where can you improve? Make any necessary changes and move forward. "It's great to have ambition to ultimately succeed in a chosen field, but don't let that make your vision too narrow too soon. Don't shut out the larger picture: that there will be dozens of ways to fail, succeed, and grow." -- Heike Currie, Program Coordinator Communications, The Juilliard School. 

2.     Be Innovative. Create a strong resume, and yes a resume does matter. Be creative with your resume. Use people in your network to critique it so that you are able to put your best foot forward. Now is also the time to be creative with “networking cards.” You need to have something tangible to hand out to people.

3.     Be Online. Networking can happen anywhere and anytime, including online. Develop a solid reputable social media presence. Improve and polish your LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook profiles. Social media is one of the first places potential employers will look before hiring you, your presence matters.

4.     Be a Dreamer. Make a list of dream companies that you would like to work for and start targeting them. Think of people in your network that might help you get your foot in the door. If possible meet and interview their employees.

Senior Year

This is your year! You’ve worked hard over the past three years to build a solid, genuine network. It’s time to put it to work.

1.     Be Genuine. Over the course of your senior year, reach out to your network. Catch up with each other. Don’t just find ways that people in your network can help you, find ways that you can help people in your network. A genuine network is mutually beneficial.

2.     Be a Mentee.  If you haven’t found a mentor, take the time to find one, whether it is a professor, advisor or someone in the campus career center, find someone that has your best interest in mind. Someone that will take the time to guide, direct, and polish you.

3.     Dive In. Your hard work has paid off. It’s time to dive in. There is a great, big world waiting for you. You are ready and well equipped, and you have an authentic network standing behind you cheering you on!
