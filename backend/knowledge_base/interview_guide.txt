Informational Interview Preparation Guide 
Before your informational interview, make sure you ask yourself: 
1. What do I genuinely want to know about this alumnus (or contact), their company, and this industry? 2. Have I done research on their LinkedIn to gather information about them for the call? 
Prior to your meeting with a networking contact, you should seek information so that you ask informed  questions. One of the best places to gather industry information is First Research’s Call Prep section of the  Hoovers business database. Find this tool on the Goizueta Business Library website. Directions on retrieving  the tool are found here https://libraries.emory.edu/media/12691 You’ll discover: 
• What a typical working environment is like in this industry 
• What the top skills necessary for someone to succeed in this industry are 
• What the industry forecast is 
• What the employment outlook is in this field 
…so much more! 
The bottom line is to prepare insightful questions to demonstrate your ability to research while still being  curious about their story and their career path. 
Navigating the Conversation 
• Begin the conversation with a brief sentence or two about your own career exploration and interests,  along with your goals for the conversation 
• Mention some of your hobbies, since you may find this creates a more personal connection • Then, move to the specific questions you have prepared for them, pausing to listen so that you can ask  relevant follow-up questions 
• Take abbreviated notes to remain present in the conversation and not engrossed in what you’re writing • Most people like to talk about themselves. Ask more individualized questions about them to help the  conversation feel more natural 
• Some conversations flow naturally, while others may take more effort. Remember that the contact is  likely at work during the conversation, so they probably have a lot on their mind 
• Prioritize what you want to learn from your contact and ask those questions first—you only have 20  minutes! 
• Allow time for the conversation to flow into non-work areas 
Possible Networking Informational Interview Questions

• What path did you follow to obtain this role? 
• What do you wish you had known as you were starting in the field? 
• What is a typical day like for you? 
• What are some of your current projects?

• What is the best way to find out about job opportunities in this industry? 
Final questions:

• Can you suggest any other people I could talk to? May I use your name as a referral? • May I connect with you on LinkedIn? 
Questions to Ask Yourself After the Conversation 
Identify the key take-aways from the conversation. Then reflect and ask yourself:  • What did the contact share that you liked about the job or the field? 
• What did you not like about what you learned? 
• What skills do you need to gain or build upon to pursue this work? 
• What strengths will you now highlight in your resume based on what you learned? • Are their additional companies or jobs that you now want to explore? 
Next Steps 
1. Always send a thank-you note within 24 hours of the conversation 
2. Follow-up on any recommendations they made. If they suggested something to read or someone to  contact, for example, you can send them an email once you have completed the “homework” they  assigned
