INFORMATIONAL INTERVIEWS 
Career opportunities are shaped and earned through conversations with alumni and contacts to learn about  what they do. The more knowledge you gather, the clearer your career path and options become. 
Below is a sample email to an alum who a student wants to meet. For your assignment, please write your own version of an informational interview request email. Keep in mind that most professionals are reading emails on a cell phone so  brevity is preferred. The email text should be very similar to the one below - because the one below works. 
Your request must have: 
• Class year 
• Intended concentration or area of interest 
• BBA email signature per the example below 
• A request for only 20 minutes of their time 
• How you found the contact (LinkedIn, student referral, alumni database, etc.) 
Your request should not have: 
• Your resume attached – only provide your resume when you are asked specifically to do so! That’s one of the  reasons why having your LinkedIn profile in your email signature helps you 
• The intention of using this opportunity only to secure a job or internship 
• Times you are available. (This can seem very forward to a busy alum – be flexible with your time as they are  giving you their time) 
• Too much information. (Remember most professionals are reading emails on their phone. You only want one  scroll worth of content) 
Example Email: REQUEST for an Informational Interview 
To: Alyssa Hines  
Subject: Emory Junior Requesting an Informational Interview 
Hello Alyssa, 
I hope this email finds you well! (You should always insert a warm greeting that makes the alum/contact feel  appreciated.) 
I am a junior who has just started the BBA Program. I am considering Marketing as my concentration and found you on  LinkedIn. I am wondering if you might have 20 minutes to share your experiences at Moxie Interactive and working in  Digital Media Strategy.  
I am happy to call or Zoom with you when it is most convenient for you. I look forward to connecting. 
Kind Regards, 
Gina Liu
