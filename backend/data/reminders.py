#Prompted with code, also has goal to select reminders for certain dates

Automatically Set date_next_follow_up
Assuming you know how long until the next follow-up (e.g., 7 days), you can calculate and store this when:
	• A new contact is added.
	• A meeting happens (trigger a follow-up reminder).
Example: Set next follow-up X days from last meeting
Update or modify your add_meeting() function to also update the contact's date_next_follow_up.

from datetime import timedelta
def add_meeting(..., follow_up_days: Optional[int] = None) -> Meeting:
    ...
    with get_session() as s:
        ...
        mtg = Meeting(...)  # as you already do
        s.add(mtg)
# Auto-update follow-up date if specified
        if follow_up_days:
            contact = s.get(Contact, contact_id)
            if contact:
                contact.date_next_follow_up = (meeting_date or date.today()) + timedelta(days=follow_up_days)
        
        s.flush()
        s.refresh(mtg)
        return mtg

✅ 2. Query: Select Upcoming or Due Follow-ups
To get contacts with reminders on a certain date (e.g., today or within the next week), write a query like:
Example: Get follow-ups due today

def get_follow_ups_for_date(user_id: int, target_date: date) -> list[Contact]:
    with get_session() as s:
        results = s.execute(
            select(Contact)
            .where(Contact.user_id == user_id)
            .where(Contact.date_next_follow_up == target_date)
        ).scalars().all()
        return results
Example: Get follow-ups in next 7 days

def get_upcoming_follow_ups(user_id: int, days_ahead: int = 7) -> list[Contact]:
    today = date.today()
    upcoming = today + timedelta(days=days_ahead)
    with get_session() as s:
        results = s.execute(
            select(Contact)
            .where(Contact.user_id == user_id)
            .where(Contact.date_next_follow_up >= today)
            .where(Contact.date_next_follow_up <= upcoming)
        ).scalars().all()
        return results

✅ 3. (Optional) Build Notification or Reminder Trigger
Once you have the above querying logic, you can:
	• Build a UI view to list upcoming follow-ups.
	• Send email reminders using a background job (e.g., with Celery or cron).
	• Show alerts when a user logs in or views their dashboard.

✅ Summary
Feature	Code/Idea
Automatically set reminders	Use date_next_follow_up = today + timedelta(days=x)
Store in DB	Already supported by your Contact table
Fetch reminders due today	Query: WHERE date_next_follow_up = :date
Fetch upcoming reminders	Query: WHERE date_next_follow_up BETWEEN today AND today + x
